- Readme should list the features and working of the app and the link to github repo of the app.
- GitHub repo for the App should have at least 3 commits otherwise PR will not be merged.
- The first commit of the Application should have been made after the issue was created. If any repo contains any commits before that time, the submission will not be considered.
